# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
### Background
V. Isualize at Pyber, a ride share company, has given an assignment to create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type and create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The purpose of this analysis is to help shareholders better understand the differences between types of cities over time so that the most informed buiness decisions can be made.

## Results
### Summary Table
By grouping the cities into types by size, the table below shows that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is inversely related to the number of rides, number of drivers, and amount of money generated from the fares. Drivers are more likely to make more money driving in a rural city versus a suburban or urban city because there are are a higher proportions of rides to drivers.

### Charted Fares per City Type by Month
By comparing the total fares for each city type over time, we can see that each of the city types does not have a wide fluctuation or any point in which the lines intersect. In January, rural and urban trends are an inverse of one another while the suburban fares steadily increase. All three city types exhibit a spike in fares at the end of February and a decrease at the beginning of March. Rural and urban fares also increase at the beginning of April while the suburban fares decrease.

## Summary
In order to make accurate recommendations to the CEO, more data would need to be obtained to determine if there are any outside factors that influance the differences between city types, like distance traveled, length of time per ride, ride time of day, holidays or events. However, From the summaries above, we can determine the following. Advertisements should be targeting urban cities for riders to drive up the average fare per ride and per diver compared to the other city types. The way that the fare is determined may need to vary per city type to maximize revenue; for example the rural cities may encounter less traffic, so they should pay by the miles traveled, where are urban cities should pay by the time spent in traffic to get even short distances. Advertising deals during peak travel times (as seen in March for spring break) may level out the fare revenue in urban cities to achive a more constant increase like the rural or urban cities.
